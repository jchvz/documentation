# GraphQL quick start

At the end of this guide, you will have created a simple GraphQL
application that connects to the Memgraph database and executes simple
queries against it.

## Prerequisites

For this guide you will need:

- A **running Memgraph instance**. If you need to set up Memgraph, take a look
  at the [Installation guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).

- The Memgraph [MAGE](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) modules.

- [The Neo4j GraphQL Library](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql/current/).

- The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

- The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime environment.

- A utility that can be used to host the GraphQL schema, e.g. [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

- A basic understanding of graph databases and the property graph model.

## Example Setup

We'll be using a simple Node.js application using the Neo4j GraphQL Library to connect
to a running Memgraph instance and execute GraphQL queries against the database.<br />

Let's jump in and connect a simple program to Memgraph.

**1.** Create a work directory. <br />
```
mkdir graphql-example
cd graphql-example
```
**2.** Initialize the Node.js project. <br />
```
npm init es6 --yes
```
**3.** Setup the Neo4j GraphQL Library and its dependencies. <br />
```
npm install @neo4j/graphql graphql neo4j-driver @apollo/server
```
**4.** Create the application file that will be used to setup the Neo4j GraphQL Library and connect to the running Memgraph instance. <br />
```
touch index.js
```
**5.** Set up the Node.js application. <br />
```js
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const typeDefs = gql`
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("", "")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs, driver,
    config: {
        driverConfig: {
            database: "memgraph",
        },
    }
});

neoSchema.getSchema().then((schema) => {
  const server = new ApolloServer({
      schema,
  });

  server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
      console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
  });
})
```

**6.** Run the application. <br />
```
node index.js
```

**7.** Interact with Memgraph using GraphQL queries through **localhost(127.0.0.1):4000**.<br />

## Current Limitations
Memgraph currently supports CRUD operations using GraphQL. That means that the entities inside
the database can be updated and basic traversals can be done, but more complicated operations
are currently not supported through GraphQL. <br />

GraphQL APIs need to be aware of the shape of data they are working with which is abstracted
into the concept of GraphQL schemas. Currently this has to be specified in the Node.js
application file explicitly. In terms of a property graph, this means the labels and properties
of nodes and relationships. The Neo4j GraphQL Library has support for automatic graph
introspection, Memgraph currently does not support this feature. <br />
